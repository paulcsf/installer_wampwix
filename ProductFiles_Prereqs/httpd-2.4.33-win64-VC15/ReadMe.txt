Install
-------
   
  You must first install the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017 x64. 
  Download and Install, if you have not done so already, see:

   http://www.apachelounge.com/download/

  Unzip the Apache24 folder to c:/Apache24 (that is the ServerRoot in the config).
  Default folder for your your webpages is DocumentRoot "c:/Apache24/htdocs"

  When you unzip to an other location, change ServerRoot in the httpd.conf,
  and change in httpd.conf the Documenroot, Directories, ScriptAlias,
  also when you use the extra folder config file(s) change to your location there. 

Run and test
------------

  Open a command prompt window and cd to the c:\Apace24\bin
  
  To Start Apache in the command prompt type:
  
    >httpd.exe
  
  Press Enter. If there are any errors it will tell you. 
  Warnings will not stop Apache from working, they do need to be addressed none the less. 
  If there are no errors the cursor will sit and blink on the next line. 
  
  You can test your installation by opening up your Browser and typing in the address:
  
     http://localhost
  
  You can shut down Apache by pressing Ctrl+C (It may take a few seconds)
  
  To install as a service. Open command prompt as Administrator and type:
  
    >httpd.exe -k install
  
  ApacheMonitor:
  
  Double click ApacheMonitor.exe, or put it in your Startup folder.
  
  
  To see all Command line options:
  
    >http -h
